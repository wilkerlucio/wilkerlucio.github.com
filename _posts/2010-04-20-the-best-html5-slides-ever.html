<p><a href="http://twitter.com/edr">@edr is the man</a>. He did amazing things at Yahoo! and now at his new role at Google he continues in the same vein. This time he has created the coolest set of <a href="http://apirocks.com/html5/html5.html">HTML5 slides ever</a>, using the technology inline.</p>
<p>Take a walk through the woods and learn about all things HTML5. Starting with the JS APIS (selector API, storage, appcache, web workers,  web sockets, notifications, drag and drop, and geolocation). </p>
<p>Then delve into the new HTML semantic tags, link relations, micro data, ARIA, forms, audio and video, Canvas, and WebGL.</p>
<p>Finally, the holy trinity finishes with CSS and selectors, fonts, text, columns, stroking, opacity, HSL, rounded corners, gradients, shadows, backgrounds, transitions, transforms, and animations.</p>
