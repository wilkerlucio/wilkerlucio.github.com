<p>[SOLVED]</p>
<p />
<div>If anyone else has this problem after yesterday update, the solution is simple:</div>
<p />
<div>open the file <code>/etc/paths</code> as <code>sudo</code></div>
<div>them add <code>/opt/local/bin</code> to this file, the end content should be like this:</div>
<p />
<div><code>
</code><div>/usr/bin</div>
<div>/bin</div>
<div>/opt/local/bin</div>
<div>/usr/sbin</div>
<div>/sbin</div>
<div>/usr/local/bin</div>

<p />
<div>The problem is this update removed <code>/opt/local/bin</code> from <strong>PATH</strong>, preventing many programs that was installed there to run...</div>
