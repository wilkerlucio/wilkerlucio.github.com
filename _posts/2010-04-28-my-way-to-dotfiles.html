After watch <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/advanced-command-line">Advanced Command Line</a> screencast from <a href="http://peepcode.com/">PeepCode</a> I realized a lot of things to make me more productive at console. So, I created a more organized structure for initializers and changed from bash to zsh. Zsh is awesome, it can complete things like git branch names and other cool things, I recommend to take a look. <p /><div>About my dotfiles flux, I made it like Ryan Bates way (I give her from her <a href="http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles">dotfiles repository</a>)</div><p /><div>The ideia is simple, in root of repository we have the files that should be on home, and also have a Rakefile with a install command, this comment create syslinks for all dotfiles to point to dotfiles directory, the install process is really simple:</div> <p /><div>git clone git://<a href="http://github.com/wilkerlucio/dotfiles.git">github.com/wilkerlucio/dotfiles.git</a></div><div>cd dotfiles</div><div>./bin/vcprompt-install # it will install vcprompt, skip if you dont want it</div> <div>rake install</div><p /><div>and its done :)</div><div>I made configurations for zsh and bash, so it should work in both (better in zsh).</div><p /><div>You can check my dotfiles atÂ <a href="http://github.com/wilkerlucio/dotfiles">http://github.com/wilkerlucio/dotfiles</a></div> <p /><div>If you don&#39;t have a dotfiles repository, you should create one for you.</div>
