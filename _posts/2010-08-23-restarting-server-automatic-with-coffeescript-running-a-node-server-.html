title: Restarting server automatic with CoffeeScript (running a Node server)
published: true

<p>Hi, this script was originally wrote in pure Javascript for Node, I just translated it to CoffeeScript in order to it work with coffeescript directly</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/546624.js"></script></p>
<p>Then just use:</p>
<p>coffee run_dev_server.coffee</p>
<p>note: while this script expects you have a file named server.coffee in same folder, you can easily change the script to fit your needs.</p>
